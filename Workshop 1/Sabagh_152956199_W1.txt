This week, I learned the concepts of classes, objects methods, and arrays in Java. As the definition of class differs a little in Java than in C++, it took me a while to comprehend the meaning and usage of a class in a Java program. I also investigated and learned about similar definitions such as methods and objects and adjusted my understandings from what I learned in C and C++. As well as the basic concepts, I also learned about the built-in methods and utilities that Java offers and make use of them in Workshop 1. The concept of static keyword interested me the most. I learned why there are used, in which situations are better to apply, and what is the correct syntax to use them.
